						<p><time>Little Ice Age</time> Freezing winters led to increased crime, disease (plague is back!!), and famine. It was the worst in 1500s - 1600s. </p>

					<div>
						<p><time>Reformation - 1500s</time> The Bible's importance was reemphasized during this time and since the Bible stated, "Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live" (Exodus 22:18), you can see why witch hunts gained traction. Also, Martin Luther, the initiator of the Reformation, said this: "I would have no compassion on witches; I would burn them all." üò≥</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li>
					<div>
						<p><time>Rise of Witch Hunts</time> Thanks to the invention of the printing press, new books on demonology written by elites, such as De La D√©monomanie des Sorciers (On the Demon-Mania of Witches) by Jean Bodin in 1580, are rapidly distributed. Also by 1580, all European nations, except France, enacted laws against witchcraft. Even Pope Innocent VIII deemed it heresy in 1480.</p>

				<li>
					<div>
						<p><time>Religious Wars Amp it Up</time> Tensions between the long-standing Catholics and newly-formed Protestants explode in several religious wars, one being the infamous 30 Years' War (1618 - 1648). Witch hunts grow exponentially during this period as the two warring groups accuse each other of being in league with the Devil.</p>

Of course this artifact had to be included. It describes the proper identification and execution of witches. Written by two Catholic inquisitors, the book is full of misogynistic comments to back up the authors‚Äô claim of women being more likely to become witches rather than men because they were ‚Äúnaturally weaker,‚Äù thus more susceptible to the Devil's temptations (many men were executed as well but women were four times more likely to be accused). Witches were also seen as the inversion of a woman's typical roles and thus they symbolized a rejection of the patriarchy. In Malleus, it says witches suck the blood from children, killing them rather than nourishing them, as is expected of a mother. <ul><b>Some interesting quotes: </b><li>"When a woman thinks alone, she thinks evil."</li> <li>‚ÄúThey [women] are more credulous; and since the chief aim of the devil is to corrupt faith, therefore he rather attacks them.‚Äù</li><li>‚ÄúAs she is a liar by nature‚Ä¶they kill [men] by emptying their purses, consuming their strength, and causing them to forsake God.‚Äù</li></ul></a>

									<a href = "https://images.metmuseum.org/CRDImages/dp/original/DP818257.jpg" target = "_blank" style = "font-size: 15px">In this hectic engraving, Bruegel draws an assortment of grotesque imps running rampant, witches flying on animals, and even the Devil himself supervising the mutilation of a man. In the process, Bruegel, living through the peak of European witch hunts, also portrays the common belief of the time that witches received supernatural powers in exchange for becoming servants of the Devil. He depicts them as using these powers to destroy Church steeples and kill livestock. This representation of witches portrays them as a real and present enemy of Christendom, therefore explaining why people in the early modern period feared them so much, not just because of their maleficia, or harmful sorcery, but also because they renounced Christianity whose values served as the basis of European society.</a>

He describes how certain positions or roles in society, especially midwives and older women, are more likely to be witches. Hopkins, being a deeply religious man, believed he was doing God‚Äôs work by getting rid of ‚Äúagents of the Devil.‚Äù He includes numerous verses and religious doctrine to support his arguments. He‚Äôs also infamous for his use of torture. He would use techniques like sleep deprivation to confuse the suspect, cutting the suspect‚Äôs arm with a blunt knife (if they did not bleed, they‚Äôre declared a witch), and tying the suspect's wrists and ankles and then thrown them in water (if the victim floated, then they‚Äôd be considered a witch. If they drowned, well at least they‚Äôre innocent!) to force confessions.</a>

The witches offer children to the devil for him to feed on, with several infants shown dead, hanging on the stake in the background and one discarded beside a hag‚Äôs feet, presumably already fed upon. Many symbols are also inverted such as the goat extending his left hoof instead of the right towards the child and the crescent moon facing the left. This painting is actually a mocking of the continuing belief in superstitions upheld by the Catholic Church. Goya firmly believed in enlightenment ideals and thus actively protested against those who sustained the values of the Spanish Inquisition through art.</a>

			<h2>Accusation of Witchcraft - Lancashire, England - 1634</h2>
			<p>Written by the Lord Bishop of Chester in 1634, this document details the answers of three women accused of witchcraft in Lancaster, England. The three women were subjected to medical examinations for ‚Äúmarks that signified a pact made with the Devil,‚Äù meaning moles, warts, rashes, etc. The charges were brought on by a ten-year-old child, indicating the reality that child testimony, or any ‚Äúevidence‚Äù for that matter, was seen as legitimate. One woman in particular, Margaret Johnson, a widow over 60,  confessed saying she has been a witch for 6 years after the examiners had found two marks on her body.<br><br><a href = "https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/education/resources/early-modern-witch-trials/accusation-of-witchcraft/" target = "_blank">Read the transcript here at the National Archives UK.</a></p>

			<h2>Examination of Martha Carrier - Salem, Massachusetts - 1692</h2>
			<p>Taking place during the infamous Salem Witch Trials, Martha Carrier was accused of dealing in witchcraft by the "afflicted" girls, neighbors, and even her own children (who were under torture), and thus was hanged as a witch on August 19, 1692. She was an easy target since she had an independent spirit and was unsubmissive. She had illegitimate children with someone from a lower class and received an inheritance of a significant amount of money and property, so you can probably see why she was targeted. She was one of the first victims of the mass hysteria.<br><br><a href = "https://shorturl.at/egAK2" target = "_blank">Read the transcript at the University of Virginia's Salem Witch Trials Document Collection.</a></p>

			<h2>The Confession of Rebecca West - Essex, England - 1645</h2>
			<p>Wallington, a puritan artisan in 17th century England, describes how a coven of witches were discovered by witch-hunter, Matthew Hopkins. The suspected witches were tortured and one Rebecca West confessed and implicated her own mother. The rest of the 19 women were hanged but Rebecca was spared because of her confession. Wallington‚Äôs anecdotes as an onlooker of the witch trials reflect the political and religious turmoil that plagued England during this period.<br><br><a href = "https://chiccmanchester.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/wallington-manuscript.pdf" target = "_blank">Read the transcript at the University of Manchester's Library.</a></p>
